# Important Notes About Contributing
- We request that all contributions comply with the terms specified in CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in this folder.

- The master branch of Bpod_Gen2 contains the latest stable release. We kindly request that you submit your pull request against the 'develop' branch of Bpod_Gen2, so that we can test the code before it is added to the default software for everyone. Pull requests made against 'master' will be closed, with a request to resubmit against 'develop'. Thank you!

- We deeply appreciate the time and effort you have invested in your contribution! Please take a moment to reach out to us at admin@sanworks.io, so that our core dev team can personally thank you for being a contributing member of the Bpod community!
